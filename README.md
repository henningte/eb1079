## Compendium of R code and data for “Prediction of Peat Properties from Transmission Mid-Infrared Spectra”

This repository contains the data and code for our manuscript:

Teickner, H., & Knorr, K.-H. (2025). “Prediction of peat Properties from
transmission mid-infrared spectra”. (unpublished).

### How to cite

Please cite this compendium as:

> Henning Teickner and Klaus-Holger Knorr, (2025). Compendium of R code

### How to use

Instructions how to set up the Docker containers to reproduce the
computations are available from the Dockerfile. The Dockerfile also
provides instructions to run the
[`targets`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets) workflow to reproduce
all computations and eventually the manuscript and supporting
information.

### Sources

Data in folder `data/raw_data` are derived from different sources. To
use these data and give credit to data authors, please follow the
following information:

- [:file_folder: d9.rds](data/raw_data/d9.rds): This file contains data
  values (porosity and bulk density of organic shales) extracted from
  Fig. 4 in Wang et al. (2015).  
- [:file_folder:
  caldat-wittington2024](data/raw_data/caldat-wittington2024): This
  folder contains data values (bulk density, porosity, saturated
  hydraulic conductivity) extracted from Fig. 1 and 3 from Whittington
  and Koiter (2024).  
- [:file_folder: CHNOSZ](data/raw_data/CHNOSZ): This folder contains
  additional data for P$_4$O$_10$ to be included in the ‘OBIGT’ database
  from the R package ‘CHNOSZ’ (Dick 2019). These additional data values
  are derived from
  <https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C16752606&Mask=6F>
  (Linstrom 1997).  
- [:file_folder:
  dry_thermal_conductivity](data/raw_data/dry_thermal_conductivity):
  This folder contains corrected versions of the supporting data from
  O’Connor et al. (2020) which I received via email from
  Prof. Cardenas.  
- [:file_folder: pmird](data/raw_data/pmird): This is a template folder
  in which the folder `pmird_prepared_data` from the pmird database
  needs to be stored to reproduce the computations. This folder is
  available from <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17092587>.
- [:file_folder:
  specific_heat_capacity](data/raw_data/specific_heat_capacity): This
  folder contains the supporting data from Gnatowski et al. (2022).
